/// S3 Client Library for Zig
///
/// This library provides a simple interface for interacting with Amazon S3 and S3-compatible services.
/// It supports basic operations like creating/deleting buckets and uploading/downloading objects.
///
/// Basic usage:
/// ```zig
/// const S3Client = @import("s3").S3Client;
/// const S3Config = @import("s3").S3Config;
///
/// // Initialize client
/// var client = try S3Client.init(allocator, .{
///     .access_key_id = "your-key",
///     .secret_access_key = "your-secret",
///     .region = "us-east-1",
/// });
/// defer client.deinit();
///
/// // Use the client
/// try client.createBucket("my-bucket");
/// try client.putObject("my-bucket", "hello.txt", "Hello, S3!");
/// ```
